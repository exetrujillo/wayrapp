# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up MSW for browser development environment





  - Configure MSW service worker for browser environment in frontend-creator

  - Test MSW handler interception in browser development mode
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 7.2_

- [x] 2. Configure development environment and scripts







  - Add "dev:creator" script to root package.json that runs frontend-creator workspace
  - Create .env.example file in frontend-creator package with required environment variables
  - Configure Vite to properly handle MSW service worker in development mode
  - Test development server startup and MSW integration
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 3. Verify and enhance authentication flow integration
  - Test existing LoginPage component with MSW authentication handlers
  - Verify AuthContext login function works with MSW mock responses
  - Ensure ProtectedRoute component properly redirects unauthenticated users
  - Test authentication state persistence across page refreshes
  - Validate logout functionality and session cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement dashboard data integration
  - Connect DashboardPage component to MSW handlers for statistics and course data
  - Add loading states and error handling for dashboard data fetching
  - Implement graceful error states when MSW handlers are missing
  - Test dashboard functionality with mock data responses
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Wire up content list pages with MSW data
  - Connect CoursesPage to MSW course handlers with pagination and search
  - Connect LessonsPage to MSW lesson handlers
  - Connect ExercisesPage to MSW exercise handlers
  - Implement loading and error states for all content list pages
  - Add "Create New" buttons that navigate to creation forms
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Integrate creation form navigation and basic functionality
  - Ensure creation form routes (/courses/new, /lessons/create, /exercises/create) load properly
  - Verify form components render without requiring full submission logic
  - Test navigation from content list pages to creation forms
  - Implement basic form loading states and error boundaries
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 7.1, 7.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Add error boundaries to prevent application crashes
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed API requests
  - Add user-friendly error messages for different error scenarios
  - Test error handling with MSW error simulation endpoints
  - Ensure graceful degradation when MSW handlers return errors
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 8. Update documentation and finalize development setup
  - Update main README.md with "Running the Creator Tool Locally" section
  - Document test credentials and development workflow
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common MSW and development issues
  - Test complete setup process from fresh clone to running application
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. End-to-end validation and testing
  - Test complete authentication flow from login to dashboard
  - Verify navigation between all content areas (courses, lessons, exercises)
  - Test "Create New" button functionality and form loading
  - Validate error handling across all components and scenarios
  - Ensure application runs entirely against MSW without backend calls
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.4, 3.1-3.5, 4.1-4.5, 5.1-5.5, 6.5, 7.1-7.5_
