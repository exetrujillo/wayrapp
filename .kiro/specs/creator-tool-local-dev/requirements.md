# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating the existing frontend-creator application components into a cohesive, runnable local development environment. The goal is to enable a stable, end-to-end "Happy Path" MVP of the Creator Tool that runs on localhost, serving as a baseline for further development and initial user flow validation using pre-existing MSW mock handlers.

The scope focuses on integration and wiring of existing components rather than creating new UI elements. All functionality will operate against the MSW mock layer without direct backend API calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to access a login interface and be authenticated into the application, so that I can securely access my creator dashboard and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application root THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a /login page
2. WHEN a user accesses the /login page THEN the system SHALL display the LoginPage component with credential input fields
3. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the AuthContext login function with MSW mocked response
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the /dashboard page
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging without crashing the application

### Requirement 2: Protected Route Access

**User Story:** As a creator, I want my session to be validated before accessing protected areas, so that unauthorized users cannot access creator tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access any protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the /login page
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL render the requested page within the protected layout
3. WHEN a user's session expires or becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect them back to the login page
4. IF a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session state across page navigation

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Display

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to see my dashboard with relevant statistics and course information after logging in, so that I can get an overview of my content and activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses /dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the DashboardPage component
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display mocked statistics using MSW handlers
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display a list of the creator's courses using MSW handlers
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
5. IF MSW handlers return errors THEN the system SHALL display graceful error states without crashing

### Requirement 4: Navigation Between Content Areas

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to navigate between different content management areas (Courses, Lessons, Exercises), so that I can manage different types of educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user is on any protected page THEN the system SHALL display main navigation with links to Courses, Lessons, and Exercises
2. WHEN a user clicks on "Courses" navigation THEN the system SHALL navigate to /courses and display the CoursesPage component
3. WHEN a user clicks on "Lessons" navigation THEN the system SHALL navigate to /lessons and display the LessonsPage component  
4. WHEN a user clicks on "Exercises" navigation THEN the system SHALL navigate to /exercises and display the ExercisesPage component
5. WHEN content list pages load THEN the system SHALL fetch and display relevant content using MSW handlers

### Requirement 5: Content Creation Navigation

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to access creation forms for new content from the content list pages, so that I can begin creating new courses, lessons, and exercises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any content list page THEN the system SHALL display a "Create New" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create New" on /courses THEN the system SHALL navigate to /courses/new
3. WHEN a user clicks "Create New" on /lessons THEN the system SHALL navigate to /lessons/new
4. WHEN a user clicks "Create New" on /exercises THEN the system SHALL navigate to /exercises/new
5. WHEN creation form pages load THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate form components without requiring full submission logic

### Requirement 6: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined commands and documentation to run the Creator Tool locally, so that I can efficiently develop and test the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs "npm run dev:creator" from the root directory THEN the system SHALL start the frontend-creator application in development mode
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible at a local development URL
3. WHEN a developer follows the README instructions THEN they SHALL be able to set up and run the application without additional configuration
4. IF environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a .env.example file in the frontend-creator package
5. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL operate entirely against MSW mock handlers without making direct backend API calls

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and maintain stability, so that I can continue using the tool even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN MSW handlers are missing or return errors THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback states
3. WHEN navigation errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashing the entire application
4. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms or clear error messaging
5. IF the application encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL log them appropriately for debugging while maintaining user experience
