# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WayrApp Flutter Mobile Migration involves transitioning from the existing React Native mobile application to a Flutter-based implementation while maintaining the monorepo structure and full compatibility with the existing WayrApp backend API. This migration addresses package compatibility issues in React Native while preserving all existing functionality including offline-capable, gamified language learning with seven content types, course management, progress tracking, and robust offline functionality. The Flutter app will integrate seamlessly with the existing Node.js backend and maintain feature parity with the React Native version.
