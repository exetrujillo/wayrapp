# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WayrApp Mobile is a comprehensive React Native language learning application that provides offline-capable, gamified language education focusing on indigenous languages like Quechua. The mobile app connects to the existing WayrApp backend API to deliver a complete learning experience with seven different content types (six exercise types plus informative content), course management, progress tracking, and robust offline functionality. The app targets language learners who need flexible, accessible education tools that work seamlessly across online and offline environments.
