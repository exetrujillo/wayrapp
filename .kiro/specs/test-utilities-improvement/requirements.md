# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the test utilities and establish consistent testing patterns across the codebase. The goal is to ensure that all tests follow the same patterns, use the same utilities, and are type-safe. This will reduce the likelihood of type errors, improve test reliability, and make tests easier to write and maintain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized test utilities that are fully type-safe, so that I can write tests without encountering type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses the `createMockRequest` utility THEN all properties should be properly typed according to their respective interfaces
2. WHEN a developer uses the `createMockResponse` utility THEN all methods should be properly typed according to the Express Response interface
3. WHEN a developer uses any mock utility THEN TypeScript should not report any type errors
4. WHEN a developer needs to customize mock objects THEN they should be able to override any property without breaking type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run tests and identify common patterns of test failures, so that I can fix them systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all type errors should be identified and documented
2. WHEN analyzing test failures THEN common patterns should be identified and categorized
3. WHEN common failure patterns are identified THEN solutions should be documented for each pattern
4. WHEN solutions are implemented THEN they should be consistent across the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation on best practices for writing tests, so that I can follow consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests for controllers THEN there should be clear guidelines on how to mock requests, responses, and services
2. WHEN writing tests for services THEN there should be clear guidelines on how to mock repositories and external dependencies
3. WHEN writing tests for middleware THEN there should be clear guidelines on how to mock the request pipeline
4. WHEN writing tests for any component THEN there should be clear guidelines on how to structure the test file and organize test cases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all tests in the codebase follow the same patterns, so that the codebase is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing existing tests THEN they should follow the established patterns
2. WHEN existing tests don't follow the established patterns THEN they should be refactored
3. WHEN new tests are written THEN they should follow the established patterns
4. WHEN patterns need to be updated THEN all affected tests should be updated accordingly
