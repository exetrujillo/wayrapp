# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WayrApp is an open-source, community-driven language learning platform that requires a robust backend API to manage educational content and user progress. The backend will be built as a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, connecting to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon. The system is designed with a modular architecture to support future microservices migration and must handle a hierarchical content structure while tracking user learning progress.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Management System

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to manage educational content through a hierarchical structure, so that I can organize learning materials effectively across courses, levels, sections, modules, lessons, and exercises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a course THEN the system SHALL store course metadata including title, description, language, and difficulty level
2. WHEN creating a level within a course THEN the system SHALL establish a parent-child relationship between course and level
3. WHEN creating a section within a level THEN the system SHALL maintain hierarchical integrity with proper foreign key relationships
4. WHEN creating a module within a section THEN the system SHALL enforce the content hierarchy structure
5. WHEN creating a lesson within a module THEN the system SHALL store lesson content and maintain parent module reference
6. WHEN creating an exercise within a lesson THEN the system SHALL store exercise data and link to parent lesson
7. IF a parent entity is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle cascading operations appropriately
8. WHEN retrieving content THEN the system SHALL support nested queries to fetch hierarchical data efficiently
9. WHEN retrieving a course, level, or section THEN the system SHALL also return a summary of its children (e.g., number of levels in a course, number of lessons in a module) to avoid multiple client-side requests

### Requirement 2: CRUD Operations for Content Entities

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want full CRUD capabilities for all content entities, so that I can create, read, update, and delete educational content as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing CREATE operations THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and data types for each entity
2. WHEN performing READ operations THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN performing UPDATE operations THEN the system SHALL validate changes and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN performing DELETE operations THEN the system SHALL check for dependencies and handle cascading deletes safely

6. WHEN querying content THEN the system SHALL support filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters
7. IF invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation error messages
8. WHEN performing CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE operations THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization. Only users with an 'admin' or 'content_creator' role can modify content
9. WHEN implementing pagination THEN the system SHALL use a limit-and-offset strategy by default (e.g., `?limit=20&offset=40`)

### Requirement 3: User Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a learner, I want my learning progress to be tracked automatically, so that I can see my advancement and resume where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN retrieving user progress THEN the system SHALL return current experience_points and last completed lesson information
4. WHEN calculating experience points THEN the system SHALL apply consistent scoring rules across all content types
5. IF a user accesses their progress THEN the system SHALL provide accurate and up-to-date information
6. WHEN progress is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and prevent duplicate entries
7. WHEN retrieving user progress THEN the system SHALL ensure that a user can only access their own progress data and not anyone else's

### Requirement 4: Database Integration with PostgreSQL

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to connect reliably to a PostgreSQL database, so that all data is persisted securely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the Neon PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for optimal performance
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN performing transactions THEN the system SHALL ensure ACID compliance for data integrity
5. IF database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and connection recovery
6. WHEN running database migrations THEN the system SHALL support schema versioning and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5: RESTful API Design

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-designed RESTful API, so that I can easily integrate with the backend services using standard HTTP methods and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions for URL structure and HTTP methods
2. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
3. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL support JSON request and response formats
4. WHEN implementing endpoints THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and validation
5. IF API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support version management through URL paths or headers
6. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL provide clear endpoint specifications and examples
7. WHEN creating a nested resource (e.g., a Level within a Course) THEN the parent's ID SHALL be passed via the URL path (e.g., `POST /api/courses/{courseId}/levels`) to maintain a clear and hierarchical API structure

### Requirement 6: TypeScript Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire codebase to be written in TypeScript, so that I can benefit from type safety and better code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for all source files
2. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL create proper TypeScript interfaces and types
3. WHEN implementing functions THEN the system SHALL include proper type annotations for parameters and return values
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript to JavaScript without type errors
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation and provide clear error messages
6. WHEN using external libraries THEN the system SHALL include proper type definitions

### Requirement 7: Modular Architecture

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want the codebase organized in a modular structure by feature, so that the system can easily transition to microservices in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate functionality into distinct modules (content, users, progress)
2. WHEN implementing modules THEN the system SHALL maintain clear boundaries and minimal coupling between modules
3. WHEN structuring directories THEN the system SHALL group related files by feature rather than by file type
4. WHEN defining module interfaces THEN the system SHALL create clear contracts between modules
5. IF modules need to communicate THEN the system SHALL use well-defined interfaces and dependency injection
6. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow the established modular patterns
7. WHEN preparing for microservices THEN the system SHALL ensure modules can be extracted independently

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

2. WHEN handling client errors THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive information
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
4. WHEN exceptions are thrown THEN the system SHALL catch and handle them gracefully without crashing
5. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability and return appropriate HTTP status codes
6. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide structured logs for analysis and alerting
###
 Requirement 9: Security and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and only accessible by authorized parties, so that I can trust the platform with my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL use a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT-based authentication via an external provider like Firebase Auth or Auth0)
2. WHEN a user makes a request to a protected endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT to ensure it is not expired or tampered with
3. WHEN defining roles (e.g., 'student', 'content_creator', 'admin') THEN the system SHALL implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific endpoints
4. WHEN handling passwords or secrets THEN the system SHALL never store them in plaintext. All secrets must be hashed securely or managed via environment variables
5. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) by using proven libraries and best practices (e.g., ORM for database queries, input validation/sanitization)
6. IF a user attempts to access a resource they are not authorized for THEN the system SHALL return a `403 Forbidden` status code
7. WHEN performing input validation THEN the system SHALL use a schema-based validation library, such as `zod` or `joi`, to define and enforce the shape of request bodies and parameters

### Requirement 10: API Design for Offline-First and Decentralization

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want the API to support offline functionality and the future vision of decentralized content, so that I can build a resilient and scalable application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests a course or a large section THEN the system SHALL provide a "packaged" endpoint that returns all nested content (levels, sections, lessons, exercises) in a single, optimized JSON object for easy local caching
2. WHEN packaging content THEN the system SHALL include a version or a timestamp (`last_updated`) for the package, so the client can easily check if an update is needed
3. WHEN designing data models THEN the system SHALL clearly separate **Core Platform Data** (like `users` and `progress`) from **Content Data** (`courses`, `lessons`, etc.). This logical separation is the first step towards allowing different content servers in the future
4. WHEN a user submits progress made offline THEN the system SHALL handle potential conflicts and merge the data correctly (e.g., using timestamps to determine the latest state)
