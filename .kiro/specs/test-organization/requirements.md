# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to organize and standardize the test files in the project to eliminate duplication, ensure consistent naming conventions, and maintain a clear structure. Currently, there are multiple test files for the same functionality in different locations, causing confusion and maintenance issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a consistent test file structure and naming convention, so that I can easily locate and maintain tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file is created THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent naming pattern of `[ComponentName].test.ts`
2. WHEN a test file is created THEN the system SHALL place it in a `__tests__` directory adjacent to the implementation file
3. WHEN multiple test files exist for the same component THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single test file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate test files, so that I can avoid confusion and maintenance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate test files are identified THEN the system SHALL merge unique test cases into a single comprehensive test file
2. WHEN duplicate test files are identified THEN the system SHALL keep the more comprehensive test file and delete the others
3. WHEN merging test files THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing test coverage is maintained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be properly organized by module, so that I can understand the test structure in relation to the application structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file belongs to a specific module THEN the system SHALL place it in the appropriate module's test directory
2. WHEN a test file tests shared functionality THEN the system SHALL place it in the shared module's test directory
3. WHEN organizing test files THEN the system SHALL maintain the relationship between test files and their implementation files
