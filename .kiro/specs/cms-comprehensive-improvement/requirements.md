# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the WayrApp Creator CMS into a comprehensive, production-ready content management system with complete CRUD operations, DRY architecture, hierarchical content management, and advanced UI features. The system will provide content creators with a seamless experience for managing the complete course hierarchy from courses down to exercises, with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time analytics, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive API Client Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified, DRY API client system that handles all CRUD operations consistently across the entire application, so that all data operations follow the same patterns and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any API request THEN the system SHALL use a centralized API client with consistent error handling, loading states, and caching
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use standardized hooks (useCreate, useUpdate, useDelete, useList, useGet) for all entities
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them uniformly with user-friendly messages and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN data is mutated THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate related cache entries and update the UI
5. WHEN network requests are made THEN the system SHALL provide consistent loading indicators and optimistic updates where appropriate

### Requirement 2: Complete Hierarchical Content Management

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to navigate and manage the complete course hierarchy (Course → Level → Section → Module → Lesson → Exercise) through an intuitive interface, so that I can build comprehensive educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a course THEN the system SHALL display all levels with options to create, edit, delete, and reorder them
2. WHEN viewing a level THEN the system SHALL display all sections with full CRUD operations and drag-and-drop reordering
3. WHEN viewing a section THEN the system SHALL display all modules with type selection (informative, basic_lesson, reading, dialogue, exam)
4. WHEN viewing a module THEN the system SHALL display all lessons with experience points configuration
5. WHEN viewing a lesson THEN the system SHALL display assigned exercises showing that exercises can be used in multiple lessons
6. WHEN creating any hierarchical entity THEN the system SHALL validate parent-child relationships and enforce business rules

### Requirement 3: Advanced Exercise Management System with Many-to-Many Relationships

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to manage a global exercise bank with different exercise types and assign them to multiple lessons with proper ordering, so that I can reuse exercises across multiple courses and lessons while maintaining independent ordering per lesson.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the exercise bank THEN the system SHALL display all exercises with filtering by type, difficulty, and tags, showing which lessons currently use each exercise
2. WHEN creating an exercise THEN the system SHALL provide type-specific forms for translation, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, pairs, informative, and ordering exercises
3. WHEN editing an exercise THEN the system SHALL show a live preview and list all lessons that currently use this exercise
4. WHEN assigning exercises to lessons THEN the system SHALL provide a searchable interface that shows already-assigned exercises and allows multiple assignments
5. WHEN exercises are assigned to lessons THEN the system SHALL maintain the many-to-many relationship without requiring specific ordering since exercises will be presented randomly
6. WHEN deleting an exercise THEN the system SHALL show all affected lessons and require confirmation before removing the many-to-many relationships
6. WHEN viewing a lesson's exercises THEN the system SHALL show all assigned exercises without specific ordering since they will be presented randomly to users

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Breadcrumb Navigation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want breadcrumb navigation that accurately reflects the current location in the hierarchy and prevents navigation to non-existent pages, so that I can navigate efficiently without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page in the hierarchy THEN the breadcrumbs SHALL show the complete path from course to current level
2. WHEN a breadcrumb item represents a non-existent entity THEN it SHALL be displayed as text without a clickable link
3. WHEN clicking a breadcrumb item THEN the system SHALL navigate to that level only if the entity exists
4. WHEN the current page data is loading THEN the breadcrumbs SHALL show loading states for dynamic segments
5. WHEN navigation fails due to missing entities THEN the system SHALL redirect to the nearest valid parent level

### Requirement 5: Drag-and-Drop Content Management

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to reorder all hierarchical content using drag-and-drop interfaces, so that I can organize learning paths intuitively and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing lists of levels, sections, modules, or lessons THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop handles for reordering
2. WHEN dragging an item THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback including drop zones and item previews
3. WHEN dropping an item THEN the system SHALL immediately update the order with optimistic UI updates
4. WHEN reordering fails THEN the system SHALL revert the UI changes and show an error message
5. WHEN exercises are assigned to lessons THEN the system SHALL maintain the many-to-many relationship without specific ordering requirements
6. WHEN drag-and-drop is not supported THEN the system SHALL provide alternative up/down arrow controls

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see real-time analytics about my courses, lessons, and exercises with actual data from the API, so that I can make informed decisions about my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real course, lesson, and exercise counts from the API
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show course completion rates, popular exercises, and student engagement metrics
3. WHEN analytics data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders that match the final layout
4. WHEN analytics data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show error states with retry options
5. WHEN analytics data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh automatically at configurable intervals
6. WHEN viewing detailed analytics THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities to specific courses or lessons

### Requirement 7: Functional UI Components with Real Actions

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want all UI elements to perform their intended actions correctly, so that delete buttons delete items, edit buttons open edit forms, and all interactions work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking a delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog and delete the item upon confirmation
2. WHEN clicking an edit button THEN the system SHALL open the appropriate edit form with current data pre-populated
3. WHEN clicking create buttons THEN the system SHALL open creation forms with proper validation and submission
