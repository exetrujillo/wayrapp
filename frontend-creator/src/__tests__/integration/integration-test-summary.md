## Test Implementation Details

### 1. End-to-End User Workflow Testing

```typescript
// Example test structure from end-to-end-workflow.test.tsx
describe('Complete Course Creation and Management Workflow', () => {
  it('should complete the full course creation to lesson management workflow', async () => {
    // 1. Navigate to courses page and create a course
    // 2. Navigate to course detail page
    // 3. Create hierarchical structure (Level → Section → Module → Lesson)
    // 4. Verify all API calls and cache invalidations
    // 5. Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  });
});
```

**Key Features Tested:**
- Course creation with validation
- Hierarchical navigation and state management
- Modal-based CRUD operations
- Form validation and user feedback
- Loading states and error handling
- Cache invalidation after mutations

### 2. Cache Invalidation Verification

```typescript
// Example from cache-invalidation.test.tsx
describe('Hierarchical Cache Invalidation', () => {
  it('should invalidate parent caches when child entities are created', async () => {
    // 1. Load initial data
    // 2. Create new entity
    // 3. Verify cache invalidation patterns
    // 4. Confirm automatic refetch behavior
  });
});
```

**Cache Patterns Verified:**
- Parent-child cache dependencies
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Concurrent operation handling
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Cross-component cache synchronization

### 3. Deep Linking and URL State Synchronization

```typescript
// Example from deep-linking.test.tsx
describe('Deep Linking and URL State Synchronization', () => {
  it('should handle deep links to specific course contexts', async () => {
    // 1. Navigate directly to deep URL
    // 2. Verify hierarchical data loading
    // 3. Confirm UI state matches URL parameters
    // 4. Test browser navigation support
  });
});
```

**URL Features Tested:**
- Direct navigation to specific hierarchy levels
- URL parameter validation and sanitization
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmarkable URLs for sharing
- State persistence across page refreshes

### 4. Responsive Design Validation

```typescript
// Example from responsive-accessibility.test.tsx
describe('Responsive Design Tests', () => {
  it('should adapt layout for mobile devices', async () => {
    setViewportSize(375, 667); // iPhone SE dimensions
    // 1. Render components
    // 2. Verify mobile-specific layout
    // 3. Check touch target sizes
    // 4. Validate responsive behavior
  });
});
```

**Responsive Features Tested:**
- Mobile device adaptation (375px viewport)
- Tablet optimization (768px viewport)
- Desktop layout (1440px viewport)
- Dynamic viewport changes
- Touch interaction support
- Minimum touch target sizes (44px)

### 5. Accessibility Compliance Verification

```typescript
// Example accessibility test
describe('Accessibility Compliance Tests', () => {
  it('should have proper ARIA labels and roles', async () => {
    // 1. Render components
    // 2. Verify ARIA attributes
    // 3. Test keyboard navigation
    // 4. Check screen reader support
    // 5. Validate focus management
  });
});
```

**Accessibility Features Tested:**
- ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation with Tab/Enter/Space support
- Screen reader announcements and live regions
- Focus trap in modals
- Color contrast validation
