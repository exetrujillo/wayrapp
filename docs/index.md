# WayrApp Backend API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the WayrApp Backend API. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the API endpoints, authentication, data models, and best practices for integrating with the WayrApp platform.

## Getting Started

WayrApp is an open-source language learning platform that provides a comprehensive API for building language learning applications. The API is organized around REST principles and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

### API Base URL
